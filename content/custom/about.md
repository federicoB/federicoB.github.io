Hello! My name is **Federico**, and welcome to my personal blog.

I am passionate about **technology, programming, and problem-solving**. In my daily work, I focus on **digitalization and simplifying processes**, especially in public services. I enjoy **reverse engineering, tinkering with hardware and software**, and learning new skills along the way.

This blog is a space where I share:

- **Technical experiments**: From software projects to home automation setups.
- **Travel stories and photography**: Documenting experiences and memories.
- **Thoughts and reflections**: On productivity, learning, and life in general.

I aim for **clarity, practicality, and honesty** in everything I write. If you enjoy **deep dives into technology or simple life insights**, you’ll feel right at home here.

Feel free to explore my posts, and if you want to reach out, you can contact me via [GitHub](https://github.com/federicoB).

Thank you for visiting!
